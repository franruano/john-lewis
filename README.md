Due to the time constraints (less than 24h notice):
- Only Grid View Controller has been completed
- ProductSimple and ProductSimpleContainer initializations never fail. Return an object with empty fields for simplicity
- Product cell set its own data instead of implement a builder
- UI is far from pixel perfect
- Unit tests don't cover edge cases
- Unit tests haven't been refactored
- ProductGridDataSource need to be renamed. It's functionality has change
- Network class needs testing
